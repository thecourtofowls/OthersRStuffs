## dataManipulation.R

1. function to create custom dataframes, 
2. print them (either by supplying string symbol name) 
3. manipulate them through functions in local environment while also projecting changes on the global environment and 
4. supplying function as an argument
5. To do SUPPLY dataframes nested within lists and manipulate them

## getDataFromGlobalEnv

We have data frames that follow certain patterns and we wish to bind them up, and since we know of their patterns, we can get a vector of their names based upon the pattern. The vector is passed through the `sapply()` function to create symbols names passed through `cbind.data.frame()`.
